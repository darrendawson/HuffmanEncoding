Lab 1 read me

Contains: hello.c, cat.c, and a Makefile

hello.c prints out hello world

cat.c takes in filenames in the command line and prints out the files (like cat function)
 - it does so by opening a file, reading and printing a char at a time, and then closing the file
 - file names are passed in as arguments

The Makefile was created from the parts given in the lab. 
 - it supports: make all, make cat, make hello, and make clean

Thanks for looking at my program!
