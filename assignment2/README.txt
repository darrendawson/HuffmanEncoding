This program is a test harness for various sorting algorithms

Pass in various command line arguments in order to test the efficiency of algorithms

 - m = minsort
 - M = merge sort
 - A = all sorts
 - b = bubble sort
 - q = quick sort
 - i = insertion sort

 - n = number of elements
 - r = set the random seed
 - p = set the number of elements you want to print after sorting

This program displays the number of elements in a set, the number of comparisons the algorithm uses, and the number
 of times it moves elements around.

min sort was written by Darrell Long

Both merge and quick sorts work recursively

Thanks for looking at my program!
