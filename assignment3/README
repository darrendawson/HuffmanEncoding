This program is a firewall that reads in a text file from standard in and finds illegal words.
It does so by utilizing bloom filters, linked lists, and hash tables. The program throughs the file word by word.

--------------------
Flow of the program
--------------------
The program reads in "badspeak.txt" and "newspeak.txt" and, using a hash function found in AES that I did not write,
   assigns bits in the bloom filter according to the proper index. We use the bloom filters in order to check if a word is definitely
   not in the firewall. 

Although bloom filters get rid of false negatives, if the bloom filters flag the word, it is unclear whether or not it is an illegal word 
   that has a translation. In order to be sure, we check it with a hash table of all the banned words. If it comes up with a translation,
   then we put it into a list with translated words that have been caught. Otherwise, we add it to the list of banned words we found.

At the end of the program, we show the user the errors in the text

How to run
-----------
 - make all
 - ./banhammer {flags} {file to read}

I did not add flex

Flags
-----
 -h n = set hash table size to n
 -f n = set filter size to n
 -s = don't print out letter, print out statistics
 -m = use move to front for linked lists
 -b = don't use move to front, true by default

For example:
 - ./banhammer -h 400 < Heart_of_Darkness.txt
